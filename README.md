# MS-Excel-Dashboard-for-Viranda-store-sales
Iâ€™m happy to share this "Viranda Store Analysis project" I worked on.
Objective: Vrinda store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, Vrinda can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023.

Sample Questions:
1. Who purchased more men-women in 2022 ?
2. List top 3 states contributing to the sales.
3. Which age group is contributing to maximum sales ?
4. Which channel is contributing to maximum sales ?
5. Compare the sales and orders using single chart.

Sample Insights:
1. Women are more likely to buy compared to men (~65%)
2. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states (~35%)
3. Adult age group (30-49 yrs) is max contributing (~50%)
4. Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels are max contributing (~80%)
 
Final Conclusion to improve Vrinda store sales: Target women customers of age group (30-49 yrs) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra
